# International-UI

## this template is used for a replica of Educell's site, similar to a template from HTML5Up.

***Nav Bar***

The about tab will open up an article that allows a description of the organization. CSS animations from Animista were used.

Login allows for access to the orgs front end page. 

Projects can be used to show current and past projects of org.

Contact will have contact information for org.

##Site Layout

The site has a mobile version that adjusts nav structure and creates a login button. This was designed with mobile first in mind and a min-width of 500px will convert to a desktop view.

##Component

The JS component allows for an article overlay to appear when tabs are clicked. It also adds a class to the background so that it blurs. This class ".change2" allows for styling when tabs are clicked.

##DOM manipulation

Styling for the button was done with DOM manipulation.

##Styling

Styling was done with a LESS compiler. Animations were done with Animista.
